The problem with this task was to figure out when upon declaring a char data type variable 'a', we try to input "1234" and while printing the same gives out "1" only.
part-1 shows this condition only
part-2 explains the correct way it is implemented when we have to input multiple characters in the variable'
(cin) function only takes one or more correctly the first character of the string, in order to counter this problem, we use getline function which we will see in Task 4.
